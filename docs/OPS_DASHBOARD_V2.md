# WearWyzer Mission Control v2 — live operations dashboard (issue #42)

## Problem

`docs/OPS_DASHBOARD_V1.md` shipped a real, working dashboard, but it is
**snapshot-first**: one blended `overallHealth` (green/yellow/red) computed
from a single `generatedAtIso`, refreshed on a 15-minute schedule. That
conflates two different questions — "is the underlying system healthy?" and
"is this specific field's data still trustworthy right now?" — into one
number, which is exactly how a stale snapshot can read as "green" days after
the generator stopped running. Issue #42 asks for a dashboard that answers
"is everything okay right now?" from data that **queries current system
state wherever safely possible**, with explicit unknown/delayed/offline
states instead of ever showing fake green, and a business-readable timeline
of what automation actually did.

## Constraint this has to work within

This repo is still front-end-only, no backend, no build step, no package
manager (`CLAUDE.md`). A browser cannot safely hold a GitHub token (issue
#42's own product principle: "never expose secrets... or unrestricted write
controls"), and unauthenticated browser-side GitHub API calls are rate
limited to 60 requests/hour per IP — nowhere near enough for a dashboard
that polls every 30-60 seconds. The issue names two acceptable shapes for a
secure aggregation layer: a GitHub Actions-generated compact live feed, or a
least-privilege serverless endpoint with caching.

**Decision: extend v1's existing pattern rather than build a serverless
endpoint.** `ops-status-refresh.yml` already proved out exactly the "GitHub
Actions-generated compact live feed" shape end-to-end: a scheduled workflow
with a scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` calls the GitHub API server-side, a pure
builder assembles a sanitized document, a closed-shape schema plus a
secret-value scanner gate what's allowed to reach disk, and the committed
JSON is what the static, unauthenticated dashboard actually fetches. A
serverless endpoint would introduce a new deployment target, a new secret
store, and a new failure mode (the function itself going down) for a
capability this repo already has working. The tradeoff is the same one v1
already accepted and documented: freshness is bounded by how often the
generator runs (now 5 minutes, GitHub Actions' tightest schedule
granularity — see `docs/automation/workflows/ops-live-feed-refresh.yml`),
not truly "live" in the request-time sense. That is what the explicit
Live/Delayed/Offline model below is for: the dashboard never claims data is
fresher than it actually is.

## What changed from v1's model

v1's `ops/status.json` is one document with one `generatedAtIso` and one
`overallHealth`. v2's `ops/live-feed.json` is a **multi-source** document:
every source that's actually wired (`engineering`, `deployment` in this
Phase 2 slice) carries its own `state` (`live` | `delayed` | `offline`)
derived from **how long ago that specific source was last successfully
queried** — not from how interesting its data is, and not from one shared
clock.

### Per-source freshness vs. event recency

These are deliberately different numbers. A quiet deployment (no new commit
in three days) is healthy, not stale — `deployment.state` should stay `live`
as long as the generator can still successfully *ask* GitHub Pages "what's
the latest deployment status" every 5 minutes, regardless of how long ago
that deployment happened. `deployment.data.lastDeployIso` /
`.ageMinutes` separately report when the underlying event happened, purely
as information, and never feed into `deployment.state`. Conflating these two
would either falsely show "stale" during a genuinely quiet period, or
falsely show "live" when the generator has actually lost the ability to
check GitHub at all — both violate "no fake green."

### Last-known-good, explicitly labeled

When a generator run's GitHub API call fails, the source's `data` is carried
forward unchanged from the previous committed `ops/live-feed.json` (issue
#42: "preserve a last-known-good state while clearly labeling it stale").
`lastUpdatedIso` does **not** advance on a failed fetch, so the source's
`state` ages from `live` → `delayed` → `offline` as the outage continues,
purely as a function of time — the dashboard shows real data with
increasingly urgent staleness framing, never a blank screen and never a
silently-frozen "healthy" badge. See `buildSource()` in
`scripts/ops-live-builder.mjs`.

### "No fake green" aggregation

`overallState` is the worst of the two **critical** sources
(`engineering`, `deployment`) only — `offline` beats `delayed` beats `live`.
Not-wired Phase 3 sources (`content`, `image`, `affiliate`) never affect it;
they report their own honest `not-wired` state instead of being silently
omitted or defaulted to something that looks healthy. See
`aggregateOverallState()`.

## Data contract

Canonical, enforced shape: `scripts/ops-live-schema.mjs` (closed — every
nested object rejects unknown keys, mirroring
`scripts/ops-status-schema.mjs`'s approach). Summary:

```

  schemaVersion: 1
  generatedAtIso: string                 // when this generator run happened

    headline: string                     // one-line "is everything ok"

  timestampIso: string

  summary: string      // short, human-readable, already truncated
  url: string | null
}
```

## Automation feed: merge-by-key, not diff-by-state

The feed is assembled from two sources every generator run:

1. `automation/status/events.jsonl` (`scripts/record-status-event.mjs`) —
   already-real business-readable events this repo's automation logs today
   (deploy health, guide factory, handoff watchdog, image renderer).
2. Freshly observed GitHub state this same run gathered: the active issue,
   its linked PR, completed CI runs, recently merged PRs, and the latest
   Pages deployment (`feedEventsFromGitHubState()` in
   `scripts/ops-live-builder.mjs`).

Each candidate event carries a **stable key** derived from the underlying
resource, never from the run that observed it — `issue-started:<number>`,
`pr-opened:<number>`, `pr-merged:<number>`, `ci-run:<runId>`,
`deploy:<sha>`, `log:<timestampIso>:<type>`. `mergeAutomationFeed()` unions
this run's candidates with the previous commit's feed by key, keeping
whichever copy already existed, sorts newest-first, and caps at 50. This
makes the feed **idempotent by construction**: the same CI run or merged PR
appears exactly once no matter how many 5-minute generator runs observe it,
without the generator needing to diff "what changed since last time" as a
separate step. It also means feed history genuinely accumulates across runs
rather than resetting — the previous committed document is always an input.

## Health aggregation, staleness, and handoff detection

### Browser-enforced feed freshness

The browser treats the generated document as untrusted cached state. On every
render it recomputes the feed age from `generatedAtIso`: 15 minutes is
`delayed`, 60 minutes is `offline`, and a missing or invalid timestamp is
`offline`. It also recomputes each source from `lastUpdatedIso` and that
source's configured thresholds. The displayed state is the worst of the feed
age, the stored aggregate, and the recomputed critical sources. Consequently,
a successful fetch only proves connectivity; it never proves freshness.

The dashboard displays two separate clocks: the generator heartbeat and the
time this browser last checked. Delayed/offline data replaces any stored
healthy CEO summary with a direct freshness warning and recovery action.

### Stalled dispatch

Engineering persists `queue.stalledSinceIso` while ready work exists with no
active issue or PR. The clock starts on the first observed idle refresh and is
preserved across subsequent runs. After 90 minutes the feed reports a stalled
dispatch, distinct from the existing completed-branch/missing-PR handoff
failure. Starting work or emptying the ready queue clears the clock.

- `computeSourceState(lastUpdatedIso, { now, staleAfterMinutes,
  offlineAfterMinutes })` — pure function, per-source thresholds
  (`DEFAULT_THRESHOLDS` in `scripts/ops-live-schema.mjs`): engineering
  10m/45m, deployment 15m/60m (looser, since Pages deployment status
  changes less often and a 5-minute generator hiccup shouldn't immediately
  read as delayed).
- `detectStalledHandoff()` — a lightweight version of issue #22's full
  watchdog (`scripts/handoff-watchdog-rules.mjs`), reusing that module's own
  `GRACE_PERIOD_MINUTES` constant and `minutesBetween()` helper rather than
  re-deriving them. Unlike the full watchdog, this doesn't fetch branch/PR
  diff data of its own — it works entirely off what the engineering source
  already gathered (active issue + whether a PR exists), which is enough to
  **show** a stall on the dashboard without duplicating the watchdog's own
  repair/escalate side effects. The full watchdog remains the system that
  actually repairs a stalled handoff; this only surfaces it.
- `buildCeoSummary()` — fixed precedence, most urgent first: a source itself
  being offline (we don't know current state) outranks anything it might
  otherwise report; then a stalled handoff; then blocked/failed automation;
  then a failing deployment; then failing CI; then "delayed but otherwise
  fine"; otherwise a plain healthy headline with `requiredAction: null`.

## Client: polling, Live/Updating/Delayed/Offline, and backoff

`scripts/ops-live-refresh-state.mjs` (pure except the injected `fetchImpl`,
same split as v1's `scripts/ops-refresh-state.mjs`):

- Polls every 45 seconds (issue #42's "30-60 seconds"), preferring
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/ops/live-feed.json` over the
  Pages-deployed copy, with the Pages copy as fallback — identical reasoning
  to v1's fetch strategy (`ops-refresh-state.mjs`'s own header comment: the
  Pages deploy can lag the committed file by a further deploy cycle).
- On a failed fetch, retries with exponential backoff
  (`computeBackoffDelayMs`: 45s, 90s, 180s, capped at 5 minutes) instead of
  hammering a possibly-rate-limited or down endpoint.
- The header indicator is **not** just poll connectivity — `mission-control.dc.html`'s
  controller combines `isFetching` / `consecutiveFailures` (client-side, this
  device's own connection) with the fetched document's `overallState`
  (server-side, the underlying sources' freshness) into one of
  `Live` / `Updating…` / `Delayed` / `Offline`. A successful poll of a
  document that itself reports `overallState: 'delayed'` must show
  `Delayed`, not `Live` — the same "no fake green" rule applied one layer up,
  at the transport level.
- After `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES_BEFORE_OFFLINE` (4) consecutive failures,
  the indicator reports `Offline` outright rather than backing off forever
  while still claiming to be "reconnecting."

## What shipped in this change (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

- `scripts/ops-live-schema.mjs` — the contract above, `validateLiveFeedShape()`,
  `computeSourceState()`. Reuses `findSecretLikeValues()` from
  `scripts/ops-status-schema.mjs` rather than duplicating the credential-scan
  patterns.
- `scripts/ops-live-builder.mjs` — pure assembly: `buildSource`,
  `buildNotWiredSource`, `aggregateOverallState`, `detectStalledHandoff`,
  `buildCeoSummary`, `mergeAutomationFeed`, `feedEventsFromStatusLog`,
  `feedEventsFromGitHubState`, `buildLiveFeed`. No I/O.
- `scripts/ops-live-cli.mjs` — the only file that touches disk or network.
  Reads the previous `ops/live-feed.json` (last-known-good), the local
  status-log, and (when `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_REPOSITORY` are set) live
  GitHub engineering + deployment state via
  `scripts/queue-github-client.mjs` (which gained
  `getPullRequestReviewDecision`, `listRecentlyMergedPullRequests`,
  `listRecentWorkflowRuns`, `getLatestPagesDeployment` — no new secret, same
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`). Refuses to write `ops/live-feed.json` if the assembled
  document fails `validateLiveFeedShape()` or turns up anything in
  `findSecretLikeValues()`, exactly like `ops-status-cli.mjs`.
- `scripts/ops-live-refresh-state.mjs` — client polling/backoff/fallback-fetch
  helpers, importable both by `mission-control.dc.html` and by
  `node:test`.
- `mission-control.dc.html` — the v2 dashboard: header Live/Updating/Delayed/Offline
  indicator, CEO summary card, Engineering and Deployment source cards
  (state pill, click-through links to the real issue/PR/CI run/live site),
  honest "Not wired" cards for Content/Image/Affiliate (Phase 3), and the
  automation feed timeline. Mobile-first single-column layout, same visual
  language as `ops.dc.html` (cream/ink/accent palette, Oswald display type,
  inline styles only — `CLAUDE.md`). `noindex, nofollow` +
  `robots.txt` disallow, unlinked from nav — same non-access-control-but-defense-in-depth
  posture as v1 (`docs/OPS_DASHBOARD_V1.md` "Limitations of unauthenticated
  static hosting" applies identically here).
- `ops/live-feed.json` — a real, committed initial snapshot (generated by
  running the CLI once against this repo's actual live state), same
  seeding approach v1 used for `ops/status.json`.
- `docs/automation/workflows/ops-live-feed-refresh.yml` — staged, not
  active (Claude's GitHub App token cannot write to `.github/workflows/`).
  Runs every 5 minutes plus on every push to `main` plus
  `workflow_dispatch`.

**v1 is untouched.** `ops.dc.html`, `ops/status.json`,
`ops-status-refresh.yml`, and every file under `scripts/ops-status-*.mjs`
are unmodified by this change, per issue #42's own product principle
("Keep the current v1 dashboard operational until v2 proves reliable").
`mission-control.dc.html` links to `ops.dc.html` in its footer for easy
side-by-side comparison during the trial period.

## What's deliberately deferred to Phase 3+

- `content` (Guide Factory stage/queue), `image` (renderer spend/failures),
  `affiliate` (link-engine coverage/broken links) sources — all three exist
  as real data already (`ops/status.json`'s `guideFactory`/`imageRenderer`/
  `linkEngine` fields), but issue #42 scopes wiring them into the *live*,
  independently-stale-tracked model to Phase 3. Wiring them now would mean
  either re-deriving freshness semantics for three more sources without the
  Phase 3 design conversation the issue explicitly calls for, or silently
  reusing v1's single-clock semantics under a v2 label — both worse than an
  honest `not-wired` card.
- CEO summary polish and dedicated mobile QA pass beyond "loads correctly
  and shows real content at a 375px viewport" — Phase 4.
- A true PWA (manifest, service worker) — out of scope for both v1 and v2;
  see v1's own "Known v1 simplifications" for why offline caching would
  actively fight staleness detection.

## Local / unauthenticated runs

Running `node scripts/ops-live-cli.mjs` without `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_REPOSITORY`
set still produces a valid, schema-conformant document: both critical
sources report `fetchOk: false` and degrade to whatever last-known-good they
find in the existing `ops/live-feed.json` (or `offline` with `data: null` on
a first-ever run with no prior file). `overallState` becomes `offline` in
that case — expected, not a bug, for a local dry run with no token.

## Testing

```
node --test scripts/__tests__/ops-live-schema.test.mjs scripts/__tests__/ops-live-builder.test.mjs scripts/__tests__/ops-live-refresh-state.test.mjs
node --test scripts/__tests__/*.test.mjs   # full suite, confirms no regression (v1 untouched)
node scripts/ops-live-cli.mjs --dry-run    # prints a generated live-feed document without writing
node scripts/qa-static-site.mjs            # confirms mission-control.dc.html's local references resolve
```

Test coverage matches issue #42's explicit ask: health aggregation
(`aggregateOverallState`, "no fake green" precedence), stale-source handling
(`computeSourceState` boundaries, `buildSource` last-known-good fallback),
event timeline ordering (`mergeAutomationFeed` dedup/sort/cap), and
fallback/offline behavior (`buildLiveFeed` end-to-end fixtures for
first-run-offline and degraded-but-not-blank scenarios; `fetchLiveFeed`'s
main/Pages-fallback and both-fail cases).

Manual verification (this repo has no headless-browser CI step — see
`CLAUDE.md` "Verifying a change"): serve the repo with `./scripts/preview.sh`,
open `/mission-control.dc.html`, and confirm the dashboard renders with no
`[dc-runtime]` unresolved-binding console warnings at both a mobile (~375px)
and desktop viewport width, that the header indicator and CEO card reflect
`ops/live-feed.json`'s real content, that every Engineering/Deployment
click-through link resolves to the real GitHub resource, and that
`ops.dc.html` (v1) still renders unaffected.

## Activation checklist (in addition to issue #19's)

1. Read `docs/automation/workflows/ops-live-feed-refresh.yml`'s header
   comment and confirm you're comfortable running it **alongside**
   `ops-status-refresh.yml` (both commit to `main` on their own schedules;
   they touch different files and cannot conflict, but both carry the same
   `contents: write` trust exception).
2. Copy `docs/automation/workflows/ops-live-feed-refresh.yml` into
   `.github/workflows/` (same workflow-edit-permission constraint as every
   other staged workflow).
3. Confirm `Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions` allows
   `deployments: read` for the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` — new relative to
   issue #19's checklist, needed for `getLatestPagesDeployment()`.
4. No new label is required.
5. Once active, confirm `mission-control.dc.html` on the live Pages
   deployment shows real (not just locally-generated) data after the first
   scheduled run, and that the header indicator reads `Live`.
